# Asset Licenses

All assets in this project are either procedurally generated or sourced from
open-source libraries bundled with the project. No external CC0/CC-BY assets
have been downloaded yet — the current pipeline uses procedural generation
as a placeholder until real assets are sourced.

## Procedurally Generated Assets

The following assets are generated by build scripts using `pngjs` and contain
no third-party content:

| Asset Category | Generator Script | License |
|---|---|---|
| PBR Textures (stone, wood, etc.) | `scripts/download-assets.mjs` | Project-owned |
| Character Spritesheets (knight, guards, nobles, etc.) | `scripts/generate-sprites.mjs` | Project-owned |
| Parallax Backgrounds (battlements layers) | `scripts/generate-parallax.mjs` | Project-owned |
| 3D Prop Models (.glb) | `scripts/download-assets.mjs` | Project-owned |

## Third-Party Runtime Libraries

Self-hosted WASM decoders copied from `node_modules/three/`:

| Library | Path | License | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DRACO Decoder | `public/lib/draco/gltf/` | Apache 2.0 | three.js (from Google DRACO) |
| Basis Universal Transcoder | `public/lib/basis/` | Apache 2.0 | three.js (from Binomial/Basis) |

## NPM Dependencies

See `package.json` for full dependency list. Key rendering libraries:

| Package | License | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| three | MIT | 3D rendering engine |
| postprocessing | MIT | Post-processing effects (bloom, tilt-shift, etc.) |
| n8ao | MIT | Screen-space ambient occlusion |
| three-good-godrays | MIT | Volumetric god ray effect |
| @lastolivegames/becsy | MIT | ECS framework |
| stats-gl | MIT | Performance monitoring |

## Future Asset Sourcing

When real assets replace procedural placeholders, add entries here:

```
| Asset | Source | License | URL | Attribution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| example-texture | Poly Haven | CC0 | https://polyhaven.com/a/example | — |
```

All external assets MUST be CC0 (public domain) or CC-BY (with attribution).
CC-BY assets require attribution listed in the table above.
